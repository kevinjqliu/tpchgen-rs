Modern, blazing fast and easy to use [TPC-H] and [TPC-DS] benchmark data generators.

[TPC-H]: https://www.tpc.org/tpch/
[TPC-DS]: https://www.tpc.org/tpcds/

## Goal

Democratize the comparison of analytical systems with tools for easily and
efficiently generating benchmark data for common benchmarks in modern formats
such as [Apache Parquet], [Apache Arrow], and CSV.

[Apache Arrow]: https://arrow.apache.org/

## Features

1. Blazing Speed 🚀
2. Easy to Use: CLI or embeddable libraries
3. Obsessively Tested 📋
4. Resource Efficient: multi-core and constant memory use 🧠

## Quick Start

[`tpcgen-cli`] is distributed as a Python package. Run it with `uvx`:

```shell
uvx tpcgen-cli tpch parquet -s 1 --output-dir /tmp/tpch
uvx tpcgen-cli tpcds parquet -s 1 --output-dir /tmp/tpcds
```

Or install it with `pip`:

```shell
python -m pip install tpcgen-cli
tpcgen-cli tpch parquet -s 1 --output-dir /tmp/tpch
```

See the [`tpcgen-cli`] README for more examples.

## Representative Performance (10x Faster)

Time to generate TPC-H Scale Factor 100 data in Parquet format. See the
[performance spreadsheet] for details and more comparisons.

## Testing

We go to great lengths to ensure our data generators produce the same exact
bytes as the reference implementations, both for single and multi-part output.
Our multi-level strategy for ensuring correctness is detailed in
[TESTING.md](TESTING.md) and includes comparing the output of our generators to
the original reference implementations as part of CI.
